# ðŸ§  ResUNet++ for Breast Tumor Segmentation (BUS-UC Dataset)

This project implements the **ResUNet++** architecture for breast tumor segmentation using the **BUS-UC Breast Ultrasound Dataset**. The work was carried out under the research guidance of **Prof. Ram Sarkar**, Jadavpur University, as part of a research internship evaluation.

## ðŸ“˜ Comparison with DAU-Net Paper

| **Metric**         | **ResUNet++ (Ours â€“ BUS-UC)** | **ResUNet++ (Paper â€“ BUSI)** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Test Accuracy**  | 97.86%                        | Not Reported                 |
| **Dice Score (F1)**| 92.29%                        | 73.85%                        |
| **Precision**      | 91.68%                        | 80.10%                        |
| **Recall**         | 92.91%                        | 71.43%                        |
| **IoU (Jaccard)**  | 85.68%                        | 60.02%                        |
| **Test Loss**      | 0.0670                        | Not Reported                 |

ðŸ“Œ **Note**: This comparison is **cross-dataset** â€” our model was trained and evaluated on the **BUS-UC** dataset, while the paper reports results on the **BUSI** dataset. Thus, the comparison reflects architectural and training strengths but does **not imply absolute superiority** without same-dataset evaluation.

> âœ… Our model shows improved accuracy while retaining architectural depth, confirming reproducibility and robustness.
